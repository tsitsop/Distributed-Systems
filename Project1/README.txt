NOTES:
    - compile and run initializer.java
      - what this does is represent a single user. 
        - It spawns a TwitterServer that listens for user input 
           and will spawn TweetClient threads to send tweets if 
            user input says to.
        - It also spawns a ListeningServer that listens for tweets
           sent by other users.
